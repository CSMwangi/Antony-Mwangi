A COMPUTER SCIENTIST BUILDING SECURE AND RELIABLE DATA-DRIVEN SYSTEMS

VISITOR COUNT

I am a Computer Scientist trained through the Cyber Shujaa Program, where I discovered my passion for combining security, intelligence, and engineering. I focus on building solutions that work in the real world—simple, logical, and practical.

🔐 When I am not coding, I explore security vulnerabilities and threat landscapes.
📊 I enjoy working with data and turning raw numbers into clear insights.
💻 I build solutions ranging from simple scripts to full-stack applications.
